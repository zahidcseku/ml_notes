    "Before discussing LSTM, let's talk about simple feed forward neural networks (aka multi layer perceptrons or MLP). I like to think of a neural network as computational unit or a parametric function $f_{\\Theta}(.)$ that takes numeric inputs ($\\mathbf X$) of a certain dimension $n_X$ and produces outputs ($\\mathbf y$) of dimension $n_y$ through a series of computations arranged in layers i.e., $\\mathbf y = f_\\Theta(\\mathbf X)$ where $\\Theta$ is the set of parameters i.e., weights and biases. If we have a three layer network then $\\Theta$ includes weights and biases corresponding to the three layers $\\{\\mathbf W^{[1]}, \\mathbf W^{[2]}, \\mathbf W^{[3]}, \\mathbf b^{[1]}, \\mathbf b^{[2]}, \\mathbf b^{[3]}\\}$. (Read [Deep neural network notaion](https://zahidcseku.github.io/ml_notes/notations/notations.html) for a detailed discussion on deep neural network notations and computations).\n",

    "The input to a neuron unit can be of any dimension (depends on the input features or the dimension of the preceding layer's output), but an individual unit always provides one output. This implies that the number of units in a layer depends on the desired output dimension of the layer. \n",

From the network, we get $n_y =1$ dimensional outputs $\\mathbf y$ for each instance in $\\mathbf X$."

    "The IMDB dataset contains 50,000 movie reviews, labeled as positive or negative. Each review is a sequence of words, and the machine learning task is to predict the sentiment of the review. What are the $n_S$, $n_E$, and $n_X$?\n",

Let’s restrict the number of words in the reviews to be 100 i.e., if a review has more than 100 words, we ignore the rest and if it has less than 100 words we add a special marker called `pad`. This gives the sequence length $n_E = 100$. We cannot use “words” as input to our neural net. We first need to convert the words to a numeric representation. The representations are known as word embeddings. After the transformation of the words to numbers, we get certain dimensional vectors for each word. This embedding dimension is our $n_X$. If we choose the embedding dimension to be 512 then $n_X=512$. To summarize, $\\mathbf X \\in \\mathbb R^{50000\\times100\\times512}$ includes 50000 reviews, $\\mathbf X^{<s>} \\in \\mathbb R^{100\\times512}$, $\\mathbf x_e^{<s>} \\in \\mathbb R^{100}$ and $x_{ei}^{<s>} \\in \\mathbb R$ is the actual number corresponding to the $i$-th embedding dimension of the $e$-th word in the $s$-th review. The batch size $b_S$ depends on the developer.\n",

The value at each time step depends on previous values.\n",

Each sequence $\\mathbf X^{<s>}$ has 30 elements, i.e., $n_E=30$. Each element $\\mathbf x_e^{<s>}$ has the corresponding temperature, i.e., $n_X=1$. For this example, $\\mathbf x_e^{<s>}=x_{ei}^{<s>}$ as we only have 1D observations. Again, batch size $b_S$ depends on the developer.\n",

For the sentiment analysis task, the input is a sequence of words (many), and the output is a single sentiment label (one). The model processes the entire sequence of words to predict whether the review is positive or negative. For the second example, the input is a sequence of temperature readings over 30 days (many), and the output is the temperature for the next day (one). The model uses the sequence of past temperatures to predict the next value.\n",
